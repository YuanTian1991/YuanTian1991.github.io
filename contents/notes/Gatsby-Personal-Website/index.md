I always want to have a excellent perosnal website (not only blog), merely for some reasons.

 ### 1. Push me to publish sometime online frequently
 
 Honestly, I think I am learning things every week, which is good, but if I don't record them a bit, I eventually would forget, then next time I encounter the same problem, I can only google them again. This is not cool.

 A blog or similar thing could push me to nicely write-down what I have learned, then publish online, which may help me to revise what I have learned. After couple months or years it could help me to look back, see what I have been though for years. In most cases, after could months of *Hard Working*, I tried to remember what I have accomplished, but I feel so sad that I can't find much results.

 ### 2. A good way to record my life

A nice personally website might help me to record my life. Like I am planning to create a page for my puppy `Mountain`, or create a Album for family. Also I like to take photos, I can only a page to share my photos.

Nice things should be recorded, and life is about moments.

 ### 3. I could try new cool tool on it

 Nowadays, JS and other languages/frameworks are evolving in a very fast speed. So constently I may see some new cool tools. For example:
 - [Text Underline Animation](https://speckyboy.com/underline-text-effects-css/)
 - [Nice Block Feel Blog View](https://tobiasahlin.com/)

And many more, I would try implement them into my personal website.
