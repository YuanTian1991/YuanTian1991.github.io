Push me to publish sometime online frequently</h3>\n<p> Honestly, I think I am learning things every week, which is good, but if I don't record them a bit, I eventually would forget, then next time I encounter the same problem, I can only google them again. This is not cool.</p>\n<p> A blog or similar thing could push me to nicely write-down what I have learned, then publish online, which may help me to revise what I have learned. After couple months or years it could help me to look back, see what I have been though for years. In most cases, after could months of <em>Hard Working</em>, I tried to remember what I have accomplished, but I feel so sad that I can't find much results.</p>\n<h3>2. A good way to record my life</h3>\n<p>A nice personally website might help me to record my life. Like I am planning to create a page for my puppy <code class=\"language-text\">Mountain</code>, or create a Album for family. Also I like to take photos, I can only a page to share my photos.</p>\n<p>Nice things should be recorded, and life is about moments.</p>\n<h3>3. I could try new cool tool on it</h3>\n<p> Nowadays, JS and other languages/frameworks are evolving in a very fast speed. So constently I may see some new cool tools. For example:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://speckyboy.com/underline-text-effects-css/\">Text Underline Animation</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://tobiasahlin.com/\">Nice Block Feel Blog View</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>And many more, I would try implement them into my personal website.</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"June 27, 2020","slug":"/notes/Gatsby-Personal-Website","title":"Gatsby-Personal-Website","tags":["gatsby","2020"],"abstract":"Can't remember how many times I re-create my personal website.
