And incredibly for each array, there are two R object saved: One <code class=\"language-text\">AnnoXXX</code> for IDAT file parsing, and a <code class=\"language-text\">probe.feature.xxx</code> for downstream analysis...</p>\n<p>This must be changed ASAP.</p>\n<p>So illumina released <a href=\"https://emea.support.illumina.com/array/array_kits/infinium-methylationepic-beadchip-kit/downloads.html\">EPIC V2</a> in November last year, which should have some difference when compared with V1. Mostly people emphasized the difference of probes between V1 and V2. However, by preparing manifest to ChAMP-usable R object, I found more things I should look into the coming future. Below are some comparison I did between V1 and V2, along with some issues on annotation side I should address in the future.</p>\n<h3>Name â‰  IlmnID</h3>\n<p>The illumina manifest always contains two columns, <strong>Name</strong> and <strong>IlmnID</strong>. In previous versions (except the mouse one), they are always the same. However, in EPIC V2, they are not exactly the same.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"r\"><pre class=\"language-r\"><code class=\"language-r\"><span class=\"token operator\">></span> length<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>unique<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>cpg<span class=\"token operator\">$</span>IlmnID<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token number\">937055</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">></span> length<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>unique<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>cpg<span class=\"token operator\">$</span>Name<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token number\">930658</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">></span> </code></pre></div>\n<p>I currently don't know why some Names are duplicated yet but will look into that. In ChAMP, I will only use the IlmnID for its uniqueness.</p>\n<h3>Number of CpGs</h3>\n<p>So this is a major difference between V1 and V2. Below comparison shows V2 contains 71137 more CpGs.</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"r\"><pre class=\"language-r\"><code class=\"language-r\"><span class=\"token operator\">></span> dim<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>EPICv1<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token number\">865918</span>      <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">></span> dim<span class=\"token punctuation\">(</span>EPICv2<span class=\"token punctuation\">)</span>\n<span class=\"token punctuation\">[</span><span class=\"token number\">1</span><span class=\"token punctuation\">]</span> <span class=\"token number\">937055</span>      <span class=\"token number\">4</span>\n<span class=\"token operator\">></span> </code></pre></div>","frontmatter":{"date":"February 17, 2023","slug":"/notes/ChAMP-3.0:-illumina-HumanMethylation-EPIC-V2","title":"ChAMP 3.0: illumina HumanMethylation EPIC V2","tags":["ChAMP"],"abstract":"I am updating the ChAMP with the new illumina Human Methylation Array, V2.
