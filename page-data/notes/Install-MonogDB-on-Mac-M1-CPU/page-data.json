Since I recently changed my computer, now I am working on a latest M1 CPU MacBook Pro. I was intended the mongoDB to install it on my computer. However, most instructions I followed are not working...including <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/docs/manual/tutorial/install-mongodb-on-os-x/\">the official one</a>.</p>\n<p>Eventually I found this <a href=\"https://linuxhint.com/install-mongodb-mac-m1/\">post</a> really works.</p>\n<p>Firstly I need to install <a href=\"https://brew.sh/\">Homebrew</a>, by following defaul instructions.</p>\n<p>Then below are key commands:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>Download the official homebrew formula</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">brew tap mongodb/brew</code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"2\">\n<li>Run updates</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">brew update</code></pre></div>\n<ol start=\"3\">\n<li>Install mongoDB, note that here <strong>I previous tried 6.X version, which is not working, but eventually seems this 4.4 version works for me</strong>.</li>\n</ol>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">brew <span class=\"token function\">install</span> mongodb-community@4.4</code></pre></div>\n<p>That's it, the installation is done. Below are 3 key command to start/stop/restart mongoDB in Mac:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">brew services start mongodb-community@4.4\n\nbrew services stop mongodb-community@4.4\n\nbrew services restart mongodb-community@4.4</code></pre></div>\n<p>After starting, below command can be used to check if the mongoDB is started:</p>\n<div class=\"gatsby-highlight\" data-language=\"shell\"><pre class=\"language-shell\"><code class=\"language-shell\">$ brew services list\nName                  Status  User File\nmongodb-community@4.4 started tian ~/Library/LaunchAgents/homebrew.mxcl.mongodb-community@4.4.plist</code></pre></div>\n<p>Then, I encountered an unexpected situation, that there is no <code class=\"language-text\">mongo</code> command after above installation, luckily I don't normally use that command. I normally used <code class=\"language-text\">mongodump</code> and <code class=\"language-text\">mongorestore</code>, glad to see these two command exist.</p>\n<p>After everything is done, I can successfully conncect the mongoDB with the <a href=\"https://www.mongodb.com/products/compass\">MongoDB Compass</a>.</p>\n<hr>\n<p>Above are steps I followed and actually worked for installation of MongoDB on Mac, I guess in the future I need to also write similar thing for Linux or other version of Mac .etc, ðŸ˜‚</p>","frontmatter":{"date":"September 21, 2022","slug":"/notes/Install-MonogDB-on-Mac-M1-CPU","title":"Install MonogDB on Mac M1 CPU","tags":["MongoDB"],"abstract":"I never thought it is so hard to install a mongoDB on Mac.
